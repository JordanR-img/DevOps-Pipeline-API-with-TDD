# Mission4

Task 5. Build a DevOps pipeline for your API
Build a pipeline that deploys your API from Mission 3 to a cloud automatically.  You need to build the pipeline using Github Actions so that as soon as you “git push” a new version of the code to your Github repository, the new code will automatically get deployed to Microsoft Azure, and your new version of API is available on the cloud.  If you can, also automate the running of unit tests as part of the pipeline.
